RAG-Based Conversational Chatbot using LangChain and Groq's Llama3

Overview

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using LangChain, Groq's Llama3 model, and Hugging Face embeddings. The chatbot maintains session-based chat history for better context retention, ensuring accurate and contextual responses across multiple user interactions.

Features

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Enhances the chatbot’s response accuracy by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base.

Groq’s Llama3 Model: Utilized for generating conversational responses.

Hugging Face Embeddings: Used to encode and retrieve similar context.

Session-Based Chat History: Ensures context retention across interactions.

LangChain Integration: Provides modular components for conversational AI.

Approach

Embedding Model Selection:

Used a Hugging Face embedding model to convert text into vector representations.

Retrieval Mechanism:

Indexed a document store with the embeddings.

Fetched the most relevant context dynamically during a conversation.

Session-Based Chat History:

Implemented a mechanism to retain past user queries and responses within a session.

Helps in generating context-aware answers.

Integration with Groq’s Llama3 Model:

Passed retrieved context and chat history to Llama3 for improved response generation.

LangChain for Pipeline Management:

Utilized LangChain’s document loaders, vector stores, and chains for streamlined processing.
